<img src="images/usos-bot" align="center">

This is an app made for automated registration on language and sports courses on Warsaw University of Technology. It uses Python library CustomTkinter for GUI and Selenium to automate the process of logging in to the USOS system, selecting the course and registering for it. You can select the time when the registration will start, the course you want to register for and the number of group you want to be in on this course and the bot will do the rest for you.
